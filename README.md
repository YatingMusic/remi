REMI, which stands for `REvamped MIDI-derived events`, is a new event representation we propose for converting MIDI scores into text-like discrete tokens.  Compared to the MIDI-like event representation adopted in exising Transformer-based music composition models, REMI provides sequence models a metrical context for modeling the rhythmic patterns of music. Using REMI as the event representation, we train a Transformer-XL model to generate minute-long Pop piano music with expressive, coherent and clear structure of rhythm and harmony, without needing any post-processing to refine the result. The model also provides controllability of local tempo changes and chord progression.

## Getting Started
### Install Dependencies
* python 3.6 (recommend using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/))
* tensorflow-gpu 1.14.0 (`pip install tensorflow-gpu==1.14.0`)
* [miditoolkit](https://github.com/YatingMusic/miditoolkit) (`pip install miditoolkit`)
* sklearn (`pip install sklearn')

### Download Pre-trained Checkpoints
We provide two pre-trained checkpoints for generating samples.
* `REMI-tempo-checkpoint` [(428 MB)](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1gxuTSkF51NP04JZgTE46Pg4KQsbHQKGo)
* `REMI-tempo-chord-checkpoint` [(429 MB)](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1nAKjaeahlzpVAX0F9wjQEG_hL4UosSbo)

### Obtain the MIDI Data
We provide the MIDI files including local tempo changes and estimated chord. [(5 MB)](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1JUDHGrVYGyHtjkfI2vgR1xb2oU8unlI3)
* `data/train`: 775 files used for training models
* `data/evaluation`: 100 files (prompts) used for the continuation experiments

## Generate Samples
See `main.py` as an example:
```python
from model import PopMusicTransformer
import os
os.environ['CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES'] = '0'

def main():
    # declare model
    model = PopMusicTransformer(
        checkpoint='REMI-tempo-checkpoint',
        is_training=False)
    # generate from scratch
    model.generate(
        n_target_bar=16,
        temperature=1.2,
        topk=5,
        output_path='./result/from_scratch.midi',
        prompt=None)
    # generate continuation
    model.generate(
        n_target_bar=16,
        temperature=1.2,
        topk=5,
        output_path='./result/continuation.midi',
        prompt='./data/evaluation/000.midi')
    # close model
    model.close()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

## Convert MIDI to REMI
You can find out how to convert the MIDI messages into REMI events in the `midi2remi.ipynb`.

## FAQ
#### 1. How to synthesize the audio files (e.g., mp3)?
We strongly recommend using DAW (e.g., Logic Pro) to open/play the generated MIDI files. Or, you can use [FluidSynth](https://github.com/FluidSynth/fluidsynth) with a [SoundFont](https://sites.google.com/site/soundfonts4u/). However, it may not be able to correctly handle the tempo changes (see [fluidsynth/issues/141](https://github.com/FluidSynth/fluidsynth/issues/141)).

#### 2. What is the function of the inputs "temperature" and "topk"?
It is the temperature-controlled stochastic sampling methods are used for generating text from a trained language model. You can find out more details in the reference paper [CTRL: 4.1 Sampling](https://einstein.ai/presentations/ctrl.pdf).
> It is worth noting that the sampling method used for generation is very critical to the quality of the output, which is a research topic worthy of further exploration. 

#### 3. How to finetune with my personal MIDI data?
Please see [issue/Training on custom MIDI corpus](https://github.com/YatingMusic/remi/issues/2)
